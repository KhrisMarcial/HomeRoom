## Mission

Our mission is to make education accessible and empowering for students and teachers.
We’ve made it our goal to  provide an online classroom with a user friendly experience for students and teachers, enabling assignments to be distributed, managed and updated effectively and  efficiently. 
The world is faced with a dire need for reliable and user-friendly educational software. Students aren’t able to sit face to face with teachers and teachers are forced implement lesson plans from afar.
